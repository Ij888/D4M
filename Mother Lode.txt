=Introduction=
So here begins my journey of trying out some theories on productivty I have discovered. Almost always I learn by dabbling and have always wanted to become a world-class programmer, creating awesome software for the world.
Once the announcement is made for the latest frontend framework, or when jQuery releases an update or the launch of some epic application like Office LIBRE, I'm usually ecstatic.
 However dabbling will not cut it, so I sought out some sound and solid theories on skill acquistuion as expounded by Messr Kaufman, J. in his well written book...
It is widely known that olympic athletes work long hours. Really long hours. So I set out to follow a regimen of workouts proposed by Micheal K.(link to follow)...

Boy things are hotting up, I just discovered that I have lost marks, no scratch that, let easy marks slip from my hands..
Java Enenterprise Edition, NetBeans, war files, entities, annotations and the all reverent servelets of JSF

Saw a post from @rem about procrastination. Its not that you do not know what to write or share about, but you think that what you know is so small and irrelevant. 

The secret I am discovering lies primarily in having many tasks to accomplish. Now this may sound counter intuitive, it actually helps to switch tasks when a task is getting boring or mundane. How much should be the optimum duration to focus on a task for?

This journal has gone on too long without getting to the point, one hiatus too many and this has to stop. Have began putting order in my work processes. Must sustain...

And so the sustainance goes on, Java proving hard with the dire consequences of falling short of an incomplete project at deadline, but though the pressure is one guess who's gonn crack? Not me, and not you. Occassionally I get flashes of inspiration with understanding concepts I have long struggled to grasp that gives me a glimmer of hope that at least I'm on the right track. Keep pushin...

Another blasted hiatus, do I have no passion for what I claim I love to do? I think it best to hype yourself, create abuzz for yourself...

Boodbath!
It was the day I had thought Java was now easy for me. Thing is

21JULY2014_Its on, the process has been kickstarted and the momentum must be sustained. Finally sucked it up and figured out DOM querying, (like 5 years late, smh...) with array manipulation. It felt good because this has been on my to do list for four years. anyways, its done now and its unto the next one. And oh, did y'all know what my Holy Grail web dev project is? Thought not, well long story short. at this meetup there was this badass dev who coded a game server in JS in four minutes flat! And i shite you not, I was ashamed for myself. I then set a goal that I must work towards becoming fluent in JS to code a server, any server without some framework in ten minutes flat. Beat that meetup badass...!

24JULY2014_I am most thankful for my life, being part of an amazing community of creatives. i am most especially thankful for the knowledge flowing freely, and I hopeto reciprocate in the same vein in the not too distant future.

26JULY2014_Whoa, its two days already since I made a pledge to push commits daily- to write at all costs (JS, Java or a running work journal). Initiating a routine, making it a habit and consistently keeping at it is hard work. Forget those chaps that try to teach you a new skill in 24 hours. You'll leave yourself only frustrated. However it is worth realising that you got to balance out certain parameters, sort of like a separation of concerns for opportunity cost. //moreText

28JULY2014_Dedication and commitment to practice. The fine folks at tutorials point said practice comes by practicing practice does not need to remember.

31July2014_The world is governed by patterns. Principles, rules, laws,  are all patterns that govern the occurrences that every entity interacting with every other entity in the universe ought to recognise and align themselves with. The story is told of this guy standing in a synagogue doing a Rubik’s Cube during services yesterday.

I’d been looking around the room when I noticed him and realised what he was doing.  And where.

And then I saw he knew what he was doing. The colours started lining up.  And then he was done.  He put it down on the table and turned his attention back to services.

Turns out it wasn’t his cube.  He’d found it on the table and wanted to leave things better than he’d found them.

“Tell me,” I asked later, “There must be a system for solving those, isn’t there?”

“Sure,” he said.  “There are pattens. You need to learn to recognise the patterns.  It’s math.  You just need to memorise some algorithms.”

He lost me at math.  And my eyes glazed over when he said logarithms.  But PATTERNS – THAT I get.  Because it’s the same in building a consistent flow of customers.  And that’s an area where I’ve paid my dues.  I’ve learned to see the patterns – and it changed my life.

You’ve probably done your own twisting the Marketing Cube this way and that, hoping to get the thing solved.  You may get lucky and solve one side.  But to solve the whole puzzle, you need to learn to see the  patterns, the structure that makes it work.

In any area of human excellence, many pick up a cube, spin it this way and that, and put it down with a chuckle.  “This can’t be done.”   They quit before they started.

There are also those who, like my nine year old, take the cube apart and put it back the way he wants it. These are the marketing plumbers and the wide-eyed techno-zealots.  They discover you can peel the stickers and put them where you want them – and no one will know!  Imagine that!

But the techno-zealots never learn to THINK. They never learn how to see the patterns, the structure that makes your work.
I beg you – don’t be like them.  There’s no pride in that work.  And not much money, either. Unless you’re the cult leader.

Finally, there are those who stand there twisting and hoping and turning and hoping until one of two things happen:

They’re forced to get a job.
Or they realise someone out there must know the pattern.  And they go learn it.

2AUGUST2014_The future belongs to those who can see patterns and rightly apply it.

1AUGUST2014_Time flies but you are pilot.
It pays to have a roster of tasks committed to paper that will need to be accomplished. This way, one is better able to deal with distractions and sidestep all those small tasks that creep up and eat into one's time. Enter productivity methodologies. I have been looking at ways to bust distractions and boost my productivity lately. 
ZeroTODOList, PoMoDoRo, GTD, GPA are some methodologies I had explored and sifted down to just two- Pomodoro and GTD. Yep, thats all you really ever need.

First give a brief overview of the aforementioned techniques.


6AUGUST2014_A two day hiatus has gone past in a wispy blur of time. You could say time flies, however you are the pilot. Can you be a productive coder when life throws all its got at you while pulling the carpet from under your feet at the same time? I dunno. I guess its safe to say that everything that is happening today was a result of past decisions wrongly taken yesterday. However in forethought I am strongly aware of the fact that back then something of a premonition about the state I have found myself in today came in dreams and visions. When one is handed an intelligence ala spy flicks one acts on it to forestall the negative consequences of said intelligence. What did I do? I rather wished it away.
