=Introduction=
So here begins my journey of trying out some theories on productivty I have discovered. Almost always I learn by dabbling and have always wanted to become a world-class programmer, creating awesome software for the world.
Once the announcement is made for the latest frontend framework, or when jQuery releases an update or the launch of some epic application like Office LIBRE, I'm usually ecstatic.
 However dabbling will not cut it, so I sought out some sound and solid theories on skill acquistuion as expounded by Messr Kaufman, J. in his well written book...

And so the sustainance goes on, Java proving hard with the dire consequences of falling short of an incomplete project at deadline, but though the pressure is one guess who's gonn crack? Not me, and not you. Occassionally I get flashes of inspiration with understanding concepts I have long struggled to grasp that gives me a glimmer of hope that at least I'm on the right track. Keep pushin...
