=Introduction=
So here begins my journey of trying out some theories on productivty I have discovered. Almost always I learn by dabbling and have always wanted to become a world-class programmer, creating awesome software for the world.
Once the announcement is made for the latest frontend framework, or when jQuery releases an update or the launch of some epic application like Office LIBRE, I'm usually ecstatic.
 However dabbling will not cut it, so I sought out some sound and solid theories on skill acquistuion as expounded by Messr Kaufman, J. in his well written book...
It is widely known that olympic athletes work long hours. Really long hours. So I set out to follow a regimen of workouts proposed by Micheal K.(link to follow)...

Boy things are hotting up, I just discovered that I have lost marks, no scratch that, let easy marks slip from my hands..
Java Enenterprise Edition, NetBeans, war files, entities, annotations and the all reverent servelets of JSF

Saw a post from @rem about procrastination. Its not that you do not know what to write or share about, but you think that what you know is so small and irrelevant. 

The secret I am discovering lies primarily in having many tasks to accomplish. Now this may sound counter intuitive, it actually helps to switch tasks when a task is getting boring or mundane. How much should be the optimum duration to focus on a task for?

This journal has gone on too long without getting to the point, one hiatus too many and this has to stop. Have began putting order in my work processes. Must sustain...

And so the sustainance goes on, Java proving hard with the dire consequences of falling short of an incomplete project at deadline, but though the pressure is one guess who's gonn crack? Not me, and not you. Occassionally I get flashes of inspiration with understanding concepts I have long struggled to grasp that gives me a glimmer of hope that at least I'm on the right track. Keep pushin...

Another blasted hiatus, do I have no passion for what I claim I love to do? I think it best to hype yourself, create abuzz for yourself...

Boodbath!
It was the day I had thought Java was now easy for me. Thing is

21JULY2014_Its on, the process has been kickstarted and the momentum must be sustained. Finally sucked it up and figured out DOM querying, (like 5 years late, smh...) with array manipulation. It felt good because this has been on my to do list for four years. anyways, its done now and its unto the next one. And oh, did y'all know what my Holy Grail web dev project is? Thought not, well long story short. at this meetup there was this badass dev who coded a game server in JS in four minutes flat! And i shite you not, I was ashamed for myself. I then set a goal that I must work towards becoming fluent in JS to code a server, any server without some framework in ten minutes flat. Beat that meetup badass...!

24JULY2014_I am most thankful for my life, being part of an amazing community of creatives. i am most especially thankful for the knowledge flowing freely, and I hopeto reciprocate in the same vein in the not too distant future.

26JULY2014_Whoa, its two days already since I made a pledge to push commits daily- to write at all costs (JS, Java or a running work journal). Initiating a routine, making it a habit and consistently keeping at it is hard work. Forget those chaps that try to teach you a new skill in 24 hours. You'll leave yourself only frustrated. However it is worth realizing that you got to balance out certain paramenters, sort of like a seperation of concerns for opportunity cost. //moreText
